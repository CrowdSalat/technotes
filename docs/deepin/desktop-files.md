``.desktop`` files put applications in the desktop menu. The files are placed in ``/usr/share/applications`` and ``~/.local/share/applications``. 

If the path to executable contains spaces it needs to be put in double quotes. Single quotes do not work.

A nice tool to edit and create such files is [MenuLibre](https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/MenuLibre/):

Install via `sudo apt-get install menulibre ` afterwards just launch it from command line `menulibre` and create e new entry for menulibre itself so it will appear in Applauncher.
