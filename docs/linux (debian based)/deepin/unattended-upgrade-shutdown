# Shutdown prevention

It may happen that unattended-upgrade-shutdown blocks the shutdown. To see if theres any progress you can look into the following logs:

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/dpkg.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/unattended-upgrades/unattended-upgrades.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/unattended-upgrades/unattended-upgrades-dpkg.log
```
